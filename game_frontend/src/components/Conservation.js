        <h3 class='header'>Mass extinctions</h3>
        <p>
            Although extinction events have happened on the planet for millions of years, the data show that intervals between extinctions are becoming shorter and shorter while the disappearance of species is advancing relentlessly. The IPBES Chair, Sir Robert Watson, has stated that, "The health of ecosystems on which we and all other species depend is deteriorating more rapidly than ever."
        </p>
        <p>
            The first mass extinction, also known as the 'Ordovician-Silurian' event, took place 443 million years ago, and lasted at least 500,000 years and possibly a million years. During that period, 86% of the species that existed at the time disappeared. They were mainly marine species. The reason for extinction was glaciation and a concomitant decrease in the oxygen available for survival.
        </p>
        <p>
            The second, or 'Devonian-Carboniferous', mass extinction came about 367 million years ago. It lasted for three million years, during which time 82% of existing species disappeared. The causes included a proliferation of algae from the emergence of land-based plants that, by turning the soil, released nutrients into the ocean. The algae, by taking oxygen from the water, caused the disappearance of much of marine animal life.
        </p>
        <p>
            The third mass extinction event took place 251 million years ago. Also known as the Permian-Triassic extinction, the process lasted one million years and led to the disappearance of 96% of species. The reason? Volcanic activity—which, according to scientists, perhaps also contributed to the disappearance of 76% of species during the 'Triassic-Jurassic' event, the fourth mass extinction. That event took place 210 million years ago and lasted a million years.
        </p>
        <p>
            The fifth mass extinction came about 65 million years ago, and saw the end of the dinosaurs and many other organisms. Also known as the 'Cretaceous-Paleogene' mass extinction, it involved the disappearance of 76% of species. The impact of a large asteroid in the Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico, put an end to the dinosaur era.

        <div class='infoContainer'>
            <p>IPBES's 2019 Global Assessment Report on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services notes that more than one million animal and plant species are at risk of extinction over the next few decades. Currently, the International Union for Conservation of Nature's Red List of Threatened Species, a critical indicator of the health of the world's biodiversity comprising assessments of numerous species groups, including mammals, amphibians, birds, reef-building corals and conifers, shows that of nearly 130,000 species, more than 35,500 species are endangered. Of this figure, 40% are amphibians, 34% conifers, 33% reef-building corals, 26% mammals and 14% birds.</p>

                    Extinct (EX) — Extinct species no longer exist. After exhaustive research, scientists around the world agree that there isn't a single living individual of the species on the planet. Interestingly, 99 percent of all species that ever graced the Earth over the past five billion years have gone extinct.

            <h3 class='header'>How Many Species Occupy the Earth?</h3>
            <p>The IUCN monitors the world's species, which raises the question: How many species currently occupy the planet?In 2016, researchers declared their collective belief that over one trillion species currently occupy the Earth. However, scientists have only observed and described about one-thousandth of one percent of them, or 7 to 10 million.The typical lifespan of a species is 10 million years. However, some stick around for hundreds of millions of years. For example, jellyfish have lived on Earth for nearly 550 million years!</p>

            <h3 class='header'>What is the Red List?</h3>
            <p>The International Union for the Conservation of Nature is perhaps best known for creating the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, a detailed accounting of the world's vulnerable and endangered species. The list started in 1964 and details at-risk taxons, for both plants and animals, which are separated into several categories.</p>

            <h3 class='header'>How Many Animals are Currently Endangered?</h3>
            <p>You may be wondering: How many animals are endangered, or what animals are endangered in 2020? For the most recent version of the list, IUCN researchers and scientists evaluated 63,837 species. Of that number, 19,817 are threatened with extinction; 3,947 landed in the Critically Endangered category; 5,766 qualified as Endangered, and over 10,000 species are listed under Vulnerable.</p>
